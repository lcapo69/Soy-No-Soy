        <li>3 cups unbleached flour</li>
        <li>2 tsp instant yeast</li>
        <li>1 tsp sea salt</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups hot water</li>
        <li>2-3 tbsp unbleached flour, to shape and transfer the dough</li>
        <li>1/2 - 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar</li>
        <li>Olive Oil (enough to cover the loaves befor baking)</li>

      <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>Mix the flour, yeast, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl.</p>
        <p>Pour in the hot water all at once and stir. Dough will be sticky and not smooth. Just get it all mixed together so you don't have mix clumps of unmixed flour.</p>
        <p>Cover the bowl with saran wrap and let rise for 1-2 hours.</p>
        <p>After the rising time is up preheat oven to 400 degrees F.</p>
        <p>Remove the saran and add another couple tablespoons of flour to the dough just to help you handle it because it will be sticky. You don't have to knead it, remember this is a no knead bread recipe!</p>
        <p>Cover loaves in olive oil</p>
        <p>Bake as one loaf for 30-40 minutes or split in two and bake the smaller loaves for 25 minutes. To know when the bread is done, it should sound hollow when you tap it.</p>
        <p>Devour hot (I do) or wait a bit for easier cutting (oh you people with restraint!)</p>
