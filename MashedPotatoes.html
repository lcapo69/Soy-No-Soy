      <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>Peel and dice the potatoes into 1-inch cubes. Place the diced potatoes in a colander and rinse well with cool water to remove the excess starch.</p>
        <p>Place the rinsed potatoes in a pot and add fresh water until the potatoes are covered by one inch. Add ½ tsp salt to the water in the pot.</p>
        <p>Place a lid on the pot and bring the water up to a boil. Boil the potatoes for 6-7 minutes, or until they are very tender (a fork can pierce the potato effortlessly).</p>
        <p>Drain the potatoes in a colander and rinse again briefly with warm water.</p>
        <p>While the potatoes are draining, add the butter and milk to the pot used to boil the potatoes. Heat them over medium until the butter has melted.</p>
        <p>Add the drained potatoes back to the pot and mash with a potato masher.</p>
        <p>Season the potatoes with salt and pepper (I used ½ tsp salt and ¼ tsp pepper, but if you use unsalted butter you'll probably want more salt).</p>
        <p>For extra smooth and fluffy potatoes, use a hand mixer to whip the potatoes until there are no lumps and they are light and cloud-like. Serve and enjoy!</p>
