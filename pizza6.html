        <li>1 packet instant yeast (2 ¼ teaspoon)</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons sugar</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>⅛–¼ teaspoon garlic powder and/or dried basil leaves (optional)</li>

      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <p>Combine 1 cup (125g) of flour, instant yeast, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. If desired, add garlic powder and dried basil at this point as well.</p>
      <p>Add olive oil and warm water and use a wooden spoon to stir very well.</p>
      <p>Gradually add another 1 cup (125g) of flour. Add any additional flour as needed (up to an extra ⅓ cup), stirring until the dough forms a cohesive, elastic ball and pulls away from the bowl sides. The dough should still be slightly sticky but manageable.</p>
      <p>Drizzle a clean large bowl with olive oil and brush it up the sides with a pastry brush.</p>
      <p>Lightly dust your hands with flour, form the dough into a ball, and place it in the oiled bowl. Roll it around to coat in olive oil. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and place in a warm area.</p>
      <p>Let rise for 30 minutes or until doubled. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 425°F (215°C).</p>
      <p>Once risen, gently deflate the dough and transfer to a floured surface. Knead 3–5 times until smooth.</p>
      <p>Shape into a 12" circle using hands or a rolling pin. Transfer to a parchment-lined pizza pan and shape the crust edge by pinching or folding it over.</p>
      <p>Drizzle about 1 Tablespoon olive oil over the dough and brush the entire surface (including crust).</p>
      <p>Use a fork to poke holes all over the center of the dough to prevent bubbling.</p>
      <p>Add your desired toppings and bake at 425°F for 13–15 minutes or until toppings are golden. Slice and serve!</p>
