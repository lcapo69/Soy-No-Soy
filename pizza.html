      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <p>Pour 2 tablespoons of olive oil into a 9×13-inch baking pan. The darker the aluminum, the better. This will give you a better crust.</p>
      <p>In a bowl, mix together the all-purpose flour, salt and instant yeast.</p>
      <p>Pour in the warm water and 1 tablespoon olive oil and mix again. The dough will be pretty wet and that’s ok!</p>
      <p>This is a different type of pizza dough; it will be kinda wet so don't sweat that too much. Just knead it up or mix it up until it becomes cohesive.</p>
      <p>Dip your fingers into the olive oil from the pan and transfer the dough to the greased baking pan. Dimple the dough using your fingers. We’re going to do this every 15 minutes until it reaches the edges. We have to stretch the dough slowly to ensure zero ripping of the dough. Cover the dough with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap and allow to rise in a draft-free place. Set a timer for 15 minutes.</p>
      <p>Return to the dough and dimple again—it should be halfway to the edges. Cover and set another timer for 15 minutes.</p>
      <p>Return to the dough and stretch it again, using olive oil as needed, until it reaches the edges. Cover and let it rise for 1 hour.</p>
      <h3>To Assemble and Bake the Pizza:</h3>
      <p>Preheat oven to 500°F.</p>
      <p>Spread pizza sauce on the dough. Take it to the edges—there's no outer crust here!</p>
      <p>Top with provolone and mozzarella. Let some provolone hit the edges for extra crispiness.</p>
      <p>Layer the pepperoni cups densely across the top—like a pepperoni blanket.</p>
      <p>Bake for 7 minutes, rotate the pan, then bake another 7 minutes. The edges should be golden and the cheese bubbly.</p>
      <p>Cool for 5 minutes, transfer to a cutting board, slice, and enjoy!</p>
